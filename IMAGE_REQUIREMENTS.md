## AI Image Generation Prompts

### Product in Use
```
A warm, well-lit study desk scene with an orange robotic desk lamp device
(similar to Pixar lamp) looking down at a child's homework paper.
The device has a small screen showing a cute cat face.
Soft ambient lighting, modern home interior, photorealistic, 4K
```

### Frustrated Child (Problem)

that's pointing at their homework, warm lighting,
feeling of breakthrough moment, genuine joy,
modern clean study space
```

### How It Works Diagram
```
Clean infographic showing:
1. Camera icon capturing homework image
2. Brain/AI icon processing
3. Speaker icon for voice response
4. Projector icon for visual display
Orange and teal color scheme, minimal flat design, white background
